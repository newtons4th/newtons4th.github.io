			<p>		
					<b>Dr. Fereydoon Namavar</b> is a noted physicist who conducted
				research for the University of Nebraska Medical Center 
				Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Rehabilitation.  
				He specialized in a form of physical vapor deposition 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_vapor_deposition">(PVD)</a> 
				known as Ion Beam Assisted Depostion
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_beam-assisted_deposition">(IBAD)</a>.
				As the primary investigator at UNMC's Nano Bio-Technology Laboratory,
				Dr. Namavar's research focused on the development and testing of
				nano thin film modification of orthopedic implants and devices.
				Prior to 2010 Dr. Namavar demonstrated, with the help of his amazing assistant
				Thomas J Gustafson, that a ceramic nano-film of zirconium dioxide
				had several surface characteristics beneficial to orthopedic implants.
				These benefits included an increase in Moh's hardness, a greather
				hydrophilicity to increase natural lubrication and decrease wear, and
				a hightened compatibility with the osteo stem cells responsible for new
				bone growth around an orthopedic implant.  These benefits also lead to 
				a decrease in the risk of infection after surgery.
				<br>

				Dr Namavar is originally from Iran.  He earned his Science Doctorate in Belgium
				before his research career in the United States.  He has recently retired 
				and relocated to California.
