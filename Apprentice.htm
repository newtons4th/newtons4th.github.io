			<p>Thats me, Tom.  I worked with Dr. Namavar for a few years.  While we
			had ample help with the biological theory for the research, the physics aspects 
			of the research was mostly limited to Namavar and myself.  We worked as a team
			for design and execution of the IBAD experiments at the Scott Technonolgy center,
			then I would run the biological experiments in labs at UNMC.
			<br>
			<br>
			Eventually, Life After Physics led me to persue a career in IT.  
			After a few years working in the private financial sector, I returned to
			University of Nebraska and now work for the Central Administration
			Information Technonolgy Services at the Omaha campus.  I am currently
			persueing a Masters degree in Management Information Systems.
