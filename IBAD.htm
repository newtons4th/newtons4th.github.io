				Figure 1 to the left, is a front view of the "IBAD," named for it's process of
				Ion Beam Assisted Depostion
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_beam-assisted_deposition">(IBAD)</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				Located at the Scott Technology Center, this $20 million room had a single purpose:  To create nano
				films on small samples.  The surface area that could be coated
				was equivalent to roughly a dozen microscope slides.  The surface coatings 
				of these slides were an optimal 300 nano-meters in thickness, 
				which is more than 10,000 times
				smaller than a millimeter.
				<br>
				<br>
				To achieve deposition, or the phase change of a gas to a solid with no liquid phase,
				a vacuum needs to be created.  This was done using a compressor capable
				of compressing helium to a partial liquid at 14 Kelvins, or -434.5 Fahrenheit.
				Sublimation, or conversion of a solid to a gas with no liquid phase,
				is achieved by bombarding a base material with an electron beam.
				The base material was placed in the crucible in figure2, sublimated, and deposited
				at the deposition point.  The ion gun in the picture fired
				ionized high velocity gas particles at the target during deposition,
				modifying the composition of the resulting nano-film.
